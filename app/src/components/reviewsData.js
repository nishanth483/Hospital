    review: "I recently visited Elite Dental care for my kid and I must say it was an outstanding experience from start to finish. The clinic is impeccably clean and modern, which immediately put me at ease. The waiting area was comfortable, and I didn't have to wait long before being called in for my appointment. Doctor Shobana has a lot of patience especially to treat for a kid of 4 years. I would highly recommend Elite Dental clinic for anyone in need of dental services.",

    review: "I went to Elite Dental Care to remove my wisdom tooth (already went 2 times for my family members) which had no space to come out and got infected too. Initially, I was afraid to remove it since it is a wisdom tooth and thought it would cause more pain and swelling. But Dr. Shobana handled it very carefully and removed the tooth within 15 minutes without any pain. I took my regular lunch after tooth removal and felt very comfortable from the next day for my day-to-day activities. Dr. Shobana called me, checked on me, and suggested things for fast healing, which was really good. The clinic atmosphere is also very good. This is a highly recommended dental clinic if you are in the OMR surroundings. The cost for treatments is also very reasonable.",

    review: "My mother had done a root canal treatment at Elite Dental Clinic. Dr. Shobana did a great job patiently. Not only that, throughout the treatment, she often inquired about my mother's health, whether she had pain or not. I am fully satisfied with the treatment from Dr. Shobana. This is the best dental clinic in Kelambakkam.",
